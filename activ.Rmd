## 3. Do the rules governing MZ B cell dynamics modulate during an ongoing immune response?


???
What are their dynamics in an active immune response?

Modelling the dynamics of development, death and differentiation in animals that are immunized with T-dep antigen.

### Immune-response dynamics of B lymphocytes

<hr>

- #### Immune activation induces seismic changes in B cell behaviour.

  - Exposes them to a wide variety of interactions and stimuli.
 
  - Triggers dramatic changes in their dynamics.

--

- Activated B cells **proliferate** rapidly and massively and then participate in the **germinal center (GC)** reactions.

--


- GC reactions:

>  1. Affinity maturation $\rightarrow$ Highly specific antibodies.
>  2. Class-switching to IgG (IgA/IgE depending on the antigenic-context).

--


- GC B cells differentiate into either antibody-secreting **plasma** B cells or become **memory** B cells.

- Responding B cells permanently express CAR.

- Immunized with T-dependent antigen: NP-CGG.

- Leads to activation of FO B cells.

A substantial fraction of activated FO B cells acquire MZ B cell phenotype.

  - New or altered precursor-progeny relationships?

  - Increase or decrease cellular flux between B cell subsets?

### BCR signalling strength is believed to be the deciding factor.
Strong signals drive differentiation into FO and weak signals lead to MZ fate.

- Fully mature follicular (FO) and very early stage transitional (T1) B cells can also  develop into MZ B cells depending on **Notch2** signal availability.
