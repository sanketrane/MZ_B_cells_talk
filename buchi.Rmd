### MZ B cell clonal repertoire:

- Augmented by flow of new cells from the BM <span style="color:#035AA6;"> &#8594; enhances diversity.</span>


- Sustained by proliferation (homeostatic self-renewal) <span style="color:#035AA6;"> &#8594;skews diversity</span>



- Depleted by loss of cells (by death and onward differentiation).

<h3 style="color:#006789;">
Can we quantify all of these processes to understand how the repertoire is established and how it evolves over an individual’s lifespan?

$\psi$ is the net growth rate:  
 the propensity of a cell for division minus its propensity for loss $(\rho - \delta)$

#### The ability of a cell and its progeny to persist within the compartment over time — ‘Homeostatic fitness'.

<hr>

???
and we can express this mathematically in a simplest model like this ...

to simplify further... we can combine the cells ability to divide and turnover into one single parameter $\psi$.
Now e just have 2 parameters!!! Voila!
We're always looking to tie the maths to biological reality - you can interpret the inverse of phi as the average
lifetime of a clone, rather than a single cell.

### Division history of MZ B cells

- Measuring Ki67 helps untangle division (&rho;) and loss (&delta;).

- #### Possible explanations for differences in behavior of donor and host cells:

  1. Residual Ki67 expression on newly entered cells, as the donor population is initially highly enriched with recent BM emigrants.

--

  2. Intrinsic differences in the ability to divide or die of young (donor) and relatively older (host) MZ B cells.
