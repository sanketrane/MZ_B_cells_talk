Parallels between B and T cell development

## B cell maturation in the spleen
<hr>

- B cells transition through **short-lived** developmental stages in the spleen.


- Late-stage transitional (T2) B cells bifurcate into fully mature Follicular (FO) or Marginal Zone (MZ) B cells.

5 % of circulation goes through spleen
blood cicrulation opens into marginal sinus where blood slows down so that Mphages and B cells guarding the sinus can filter it for antigens/pathogens.

MZ B cells are strategically positions to locate pathogens that breach systemic barrier and emerge in blood.

- FO B cells typically respond to antigens presented by Dendritic cells and Macrophages in a **T cell dependent manner** and produce high-affinity antibodies.

- #### MZ B cells are responsible for generation of **Natural antibodies.** 
  - Pre-made reservoir of antibodies in healthy individuals without previous immunizations/infections.
  - Natural antibodies limit the dissemination of pathogens. 
  - Pivotal in the early phases of infection and before the highly specific T and B cell response is engaged.

--

- #### Natural antibodies also play a significant role in controlling **autoimmune pathologies**.
  - Indeed, in humans MZ B cells are associated with
      - Sjögren’s syndrome, 
      - Graves’ disease and
      - autoimmune vasculitis.

### Jack of all trades

+ Response against **T-independent antigens** predominantly comes from MZ B cells.

--

+ They **transport** captured antigens to the follicles.

--

+ They present antigens to T cells and activate them, faster than FO B cells.

--

+ They are also capable of forming germinal centers that lead to somatically mutated and class-switched memory.
