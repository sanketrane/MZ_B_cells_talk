## B cell maturation in the spleen
<hr>

- B cells transition through **short-lived** developmental stages in the spleen.


- Late-stage transitional (T2) B cells bifurcate into fully mature Follicular (FO) or Marginal Zone (MZ) B cells.

5 % of circulation goes through spleen
blood cicrulation opens into marginal sinus where blood slows down so that Mphages and B cells guarding the sinus can filter it for antigens/pathogens.

MZ B cells are strategically positions to locate pathogens that breach systemic barrier and emerge in blood.

- FO B cells typically respond to antigens presented by Dendritic cells and Macrophages in a **T cell dependent manner** and produce high-affinity antibodies.

- #### MZ B cells are responsible for generation of **Natural antibodies.** 
  - Pre-made reservoir of antibodies in healthy individuals without previous immunizations/infections.
  - Pivotal in the early phases of infection and in **autoimmune pathologies** such as Sjögren’s syndrome, Graves’ disease and autoimmune vasculitis.

- Response against **T-independent antigens** predominantly comes from MZ B cells.

- They also present antigens to T cells and activate them, faster than FO B cells.

### MZ B cells represent a crossover between innate and adaptive immunity, spearheading early antibody responses against systemic pathogens

TI antigens, in general failure to elicit high-affinity antibody response by FO B cells.

Despite their importance multiple aspects of their biology remain poorly answered.
There is a new wave of interest -- explosion of interest in understnading their physiology and I am riding that wave.

It is difficult to study MZ B cells in humans because they are cecile, primarily located in spleen and are rarely found in blood.
Most of this work is in mouse models.
We hope to make sense of human pathologies in the light of findings from mice and in future aim to translate them in humans.
